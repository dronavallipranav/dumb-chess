# DumbChess

A terrible chess engine written in Go. Meant to look for the worst moves, a task that is the inverse of a good chess engine's goal. Sadly, It is not even the best at finding the worst move. Truly mediocre...

# Usage

1.build the project
```sh
go build
```
2.run cli
```sh
./dumbChess cli
```

Implements the UCI protocol so the engine can be added to a GUI environment as well
